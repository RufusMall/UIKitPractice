# UIKitPractice
Just building some UI for practice. Using code as most time I have been using storyboards

## Facebook

Clone of facebook homepage WIP Shows how to use Autolayout for self sizing collectionview cells. They all dynamically size depending on content.

Added custom Facebook navigation title view that scrolls with the collectionview and fades away.
